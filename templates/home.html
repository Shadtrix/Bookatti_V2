        <p>
            Every book in our library is part of a larger sustainability effort. By offering books for borrowing, we ensure that each book reaches multiple readers, extending its life and minimizing waste.
            When books reach the end of their lifecycle, we recycle them responsibly or donate them to charitable causes.
